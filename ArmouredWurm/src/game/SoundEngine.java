 * This will be the sound Class, it will have a queue that the Engine sends sounds to, 
 * this classes job will be to look at the queue and if there is a sound in the queue. play this sound.
 * it will also have volume control and other such things. 
 * 
 *  Ideas:
 *  Map ( String -> sound)
 *  whens the engine starts it will load all the sounds to a map 
 *  
 *  then when something wants to make a sound they will send a STring over through the queue. 
 *  the sound will look at the String find the appropriate sound in the Map and play it.
 *  
 *  text file with all the availible sounds?
 *  
 *  Level music on loop?
